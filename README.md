# PowerPulse_Outage-Tracker
PowerPulse is a desktop-based Java application that enables local citizens to report and track power outages in their neighborhood. Designed with a simple GUI using Java Swing, the system simulates real-world outage management where users can log issues, view all reports, and mark them as resolved.

This project showcases file-based data persistence, basic CRUD operations, and a user-friendly graphical interface â€” perfect for showcasing Java and OOP skills in a real-life use case.

Problem Solved:
In many urban and semi-urban areas, people face electricity blackouts but are unaware of:

Whether others are affected

When it might be resolved

How to track or report it

PowerPulse fills this gap by allowing people to log and view outage events locally.
